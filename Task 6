# Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📌 Objective

Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Online password strength checkers (e.g., **passwordmeter.com**, **bitwarden strength tester**)

## 📄 Deliverables

A report showing password strength results and explanation.

# 🔐 1. Passwords With Varying Complexity

Below are example passwords (generic, non‑personal) created with different complexity levels.

### **A. Weak Password**

* **Password:** `appletree`
* **Length:** 10
* **Complexity:** Low
* **Reason:** Only lowercase letters, dictionary word

### **B. Medium Password**

* **Password:** `home1234`
* **Length:** 8
* **Complexity:** Medium
* **Reason:** Contains numbers but predictable pattern

### **C. Strong Password**

* **Password:** `RoCk91Star`
* **Length:** 10
* **Complexity:** High
* **Reason:** Uppercase + lowercase + numbers

### **D. Very Strong Password**

* **Password:** `@Sky91!RoCk#`
* **Length:** 12
* **Complexity:** Very High
* **Reason:** Uses all character types + good length

# 🧪 2. Password Strength Evaluation Results

Results collected from password strength checkers.

| Password     | Score | Rating      | Feedback                                |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| appletree    | 15%   | Weak        | No numbers/symbols, dictionary word     |
| home1234     | 35%   | Medium      | Common pattern, short length            |
| RoCk91Star   | 70%   | Strong      | Good mix of characters, could be longer |
| @Sky91!RoCk# | 95%   | Very Strong | Excellent complexity and randomness     |

# 📝 3. Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

* Use **12+ characters**
* Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
* Avoid dictionary words or common patterns
* Do not use personal info (DOB, names, phone numbers)
* Use random combinations
* Prefer passphrases when possible
* Never reuse passwords across sites

---

# 🔍 4. Common Password Attacks

### **Brute Force Attack**

Tries every possible combination; short passwords break fast.

### **Dictionary Attack**

Uses databases of common words to guess simple passwords.

### **Credential Stuffing**

Uses leaked credentials from previous breaches.

### **Social Engineering**

Tricks the user into revealing their password.

# 🧠 5. How Password Complexity Improves Security

* Longer passwords take exponentially more time to crack.
* Mixing character types increases entropy.
* Avoiding patterns prevents dictionary-based cracking.
* Strong, random passwords resist brute force for thousands to millions of years.

Example:

* **6‑character simple password:** crackable in minutes
* **12‑character complex password:** may take millions of years

# ✅ Summary

This task demonstrates how password strength increases with:

* Character variety
* Increased length
* Randomness

Using password checkers helps validate strength and improve security understanding.
